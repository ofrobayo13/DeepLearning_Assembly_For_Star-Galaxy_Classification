# DeepLearning_Assembly_For_Star-Galaxy_Classification
Deep Learning models applied to detect and classificate pictures of stars and galaxies. This project uses an MobilenetSSDv2 for detection and ResNet for classification.

Astronomy is a science that allows us to understand the structure and evolution of the universe we 
live in. One of the fundamental tasks in astronomical research is the identification and classification 
of light sources in images captured by telescopes, specifically between stars and galaxies. However, 
distinguishing between these celestial bodies in an image can be challenging since both can appear 
similar in shape and size from certain distances. On the other hand, recent and upcoming sky 
surveys provide enormous amounts of information in the form of images (on the order of tens of 
terabytes per week). Identifying and classifying sources in such data sets becomes an impractical 
task if done manually by humans, and it becomes necessary to use computational tools to solve the 
problem. In this project, a solution to this problem is presented through a framework that combines 
and exploits two deep learning models: MobileNetSSDv2 for object detection and ResNet for 
classifying the detected objects. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
this approach in accurately identifying astronomical light sources in images. The models were 
trained using convolutional neural networks and deep learning techniques, which provide better 
results than other methods based on manual feature engineering or support vector machines (SVM). 
These methods were trained using the public dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
